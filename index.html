        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a creative and driven person, currently working on my Bachelor’s in Game Development and Master’s in
            Cybersecurity at Boise State University. I love blending storytelling with gameplay to create unique,
            immersive worlds that spark imagination and keep players engaged.</p>
        <p>I’ve worked on everything from RTS games with procedural generation to AR experiences, mainly using Unity. My
            goal is to not just make games that are fun but also safe and seamless, exploring how cybersecurity can
            enhance player experiences.</p>
        <p>Outside of game development, I enjoy drawing (especially anime and realistic styles), singing, and telling
            stories that make people laugh or think. Being part of the Pristine Jazz Choir helped me develop confidence
            in performance and collaboration, which I bring into everything I do.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, I want to create worlds and experiences that inspire people and leave a lasting
            impact.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Certified Pharmacy Technician, St. Luke's Health System</h3>
        <p><em>Aug 2020 – Present · Meridian, Idaho</em></p>
        <p>I’m a Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT 4) who takes pride in going beyond the basics of the role. I train
            and mentor new technicians, helping them develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed. In my
            day-to-day work, I compound medications with precision and ensure compliance with all safety and regulatory
            standards.</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about improving workflows and processes to make things more efficient and accurate. I’ve
            handled audits, implemented new systems, and designed a Controlled Substance Log powered by VBA in Excel to
            streamline the tracking of controlled substances. This tool has significantly enhanced accountability and
            saved time for the entire team.</p>
